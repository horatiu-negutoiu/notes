# LLM / Wording

## "Write" vs "Generate" vs "Craft"

- Write: implies structured, intentional and refined. The model may focus on producing something well-formed, coherent, and appropriate to the given context. If you want content that feels more natural and polished, “write” may be the better choice.

- Generate: This leans more toward raw creativity, variety, and novelty. It suggests that the model should explore multiple possibilities and produce options that may be unexpected or unique. If you want a diverse range of content or a brainstorming-like output, “generate” is likely more effective.

- Craft: Adds an extra layer of intentionality, nuance, and quality to the output. It suggests that the content should be both creative and strategic, rather than just mechanically written or randomly generated.


## "Important" Notes

Always place "important" notes at the end of a prompt (as opposed as the middle), because the latest instructions carry the most weight.

Ex DON'T:
```
- do this
- **important**: make sure you do this
- do this too
```

Ex DO:
```
- do this
- and do this
- **Important:** make sure you do this
```

## Spacing

Spacing "slightly" improves readability, so it helps to add blank lines after titles.

## Order of categories

Adjusting the order of categories in your prompt can meaningfully influence the effectiveness and focus of the generated content. Generally, placing **the most critical or foundational information first**, followed by increasingly broader contextual guidelines, leads to stronger and more focused responses.
