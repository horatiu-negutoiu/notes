# GCP MLE Certification / Study Guide

## Focus Areas

- Section 1: Architecting low-code ML solutions
  - 1.1: Developing ML models using BigQuery ML
    - Building the appropriate BigQuery ML model (eg. linear and binary classification, regression, time-series, matrix factorization, boosted trees, autoencoders).
    - Feature engineering or selection using BigQuery ML.
    - Generating predictions by using BigQuery ML.
  - 1.2: Building AI solutions by using ML APIs or foundational models
    - Building applications by using ML APIs (eg. Cloud Vision API, Natural Language API, Cloud Speech API, Translation) from Model Garden.
    - Building applications by using industry-specific APIs (eg. Document AI API, Retail API).
    - Implementing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications with Vertex AI Agent Builder by leveraging pre-built components and minimal coding for faster development or utilizing visual, o-code tools without writing any code.
  - 1.3: Training models by using AutoML
    - Preparing data for AutoML (eg. feature selection, data labeling, Tabular Workflows on AutoML).
    - Using available data (eg. tabular text, speech, images, videos) to train custom models.
    - Using AutoML for tabular data.
    - Creating forecasting models using AutoML.
    - Configuring and debugging trained models.
- Section 2: Collaborating across teams to maage data and models
  - 2.1: Exploring and preprocessing organization-wide data (eg. Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Spanner, Cloud SQL, Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop)
    - Organizing different types of data (eg. tabular, text, speech, images, videos) for efficient training.
    - Managing datasets in Vertex AI.
    - Data preprocessing (eg. Dataflow, TensorFlow Extended [TFX], BigQuery)
    - Creating and consolidating features in Vertex AI Feature Store.
    - Privacy implications of data usage and/or collection (eg. handling sensitive data such as personally identifiable information [PII] and protected health information [PHI]).
    - Ingesting different data sources (eg. text documents) into Vertex AI for inference.
