# GCP MLE Certification / Exam Guide

## Exam Overview

[Link to exam guide](./resources/exam-guide-v4.0.pdf)

- 60 question exam in 120 mins
- all multiple-choice
- no coding (or almost no coding)! (so make sure you know concepts)

MLE-related topics not focused on:
- less focus on classification metrics (precision, recall, PR-AUC, F1 score)


### Sections

Section 1: Architecting low-code AI solutions
- Developing ML models using BigQuery ML (appropriate model, feature engineering, predictions)
- ML APIs (Model Garden, Document AI API, Retail API, RAG)
- AutoML (preparing data, forecasting, configuring, debugging)

Section 2: Collaborating within and across teams to manage data and models
- Preprocessing data (GCS, BigQuery, Spanner, SQL, Spark, Hadoop)
- Jupyter notebook model prototyping
- Tracking and running ML experiments (evaluation)

Section 3: Scaling prototypes into ML models
- Choosing ML framework and architecture, techniques
- Training models (training data, SDKs, Hyperparameter Tuning, fine-tuning)
- Choosing appropriate hardware

Section 4: Serving and scaling models
- Serving batch/online models, frameworks, registry, A/B testing
- Scaling online model serving (Vertex AI, backend scaling, tuning and optimization for production)

Section 5: Automating and orchestrating ML pipelines
- Developing end-to-end ML pipelines (data and model validation, pipelines, orchestration frameworks, hybrid/multi-cloud strategies, system design)
- Automating model retraining (retraining policy, ci/cd for model deployment)
- Tracking and auditing metadata (model artifacts, dataset versioning, model and data lineage)

Section 6: Monitoring AI solutions
- Identifying risks to AI solutions (securing AI systems, bias, explainability)
- Monitoring, testing and troubleshooting AI solutions (continuous evaluation, training-serving skew, feature attribution drift, simpler models, serving errors)
